Great leaders create learning loops — structured reflection after decisions, whether they worked out or not. They ask: What did I sense? What did I miss? What patterns am I noticing? This narrative follows leaders who have built reflection into their daily practice, turning every decision into a learning opportunity. Organizations that learn quickly share a common trait: they pause to reflect, capture insights, and adjust their intuitive calibration based on outcomes. The learning loop transforms intuition from a mysterious gift into a skill that improves over time.\\n\\n## The Science\\n\\nFeedback loops are essential for developing expertise. Predictive coding — the brain\'s ability to generate expectations and compare them to outcomes — underlies learning. Deliberate practice, as described by Anders Ericsson, requires focused attention, immediate feedback, and iterative refinement. Research shows that experts in any domain develop better intuition through thousands of hours of practice with clear feedback.
