## Narrative

Some leaders seem to see the future. Satya Nadella pivoted Microsoft toward cloud and culture before the trends were obvious. Netflix bet on streaming when Blockbuster was still dominant. These leaders developed future sense — the ability to anticipate trends, create options, and position for possibilities that don't yet exist. The narrative explores how great leaders develop foresight, combining pattern recognition, scenario thinking, and the willingness to create options before they're needed. This future sense allows leaders to move early, capture opportunities, and avoid being caught flat-footed by change.

## The Science

Anticipatory networks in the brain allow us to simulate future scenarios and evaluate possibilities. Scenario thinking leverages these networks, creating mental models of different futures and evaluating which are most likely. Research shows that expert leaders activate forward-looking brain regions, maintaining mental models of multiple possible futures. Neuroscience reveals that foresight improves when we regularly practice scenario thinking, creating and updating mental models of the future. The science of anticipation and scenario planning shows how to develop future sense.

## Case Studies

Companies that created options early captured massive value. NVIDIA positioned for AI acceleration before the trend was obvious. Leaders who developed future sense made strategic bets that seemed risky at the time but proved prescient. These case studies demonstrate how foresight and scenario thinking enable leaders to anticipate trends, create options, and position for future possibilities. The pattern is clear: those who develop future sense make better strategic decisions and create more long-term value.
