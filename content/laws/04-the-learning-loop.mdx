## Narrative

Intuition gets sharper with feedback. Great leaders create learning loops — structured reflection after decisions, whether they worked out or not. They ask: What did I sense? What did I miss? What patterns am I noticing? This narrative follows leaders who have built reflection into their daily practice, turning every decision into a learning opportunity. Organizations that learn quickly share a common trait: they pause to reflect, capture insights, and adjust their intuitive calibration based on outcomes. The learning loop transforms intuition from a mysterious gift into a skill that improves over time.

## The Science

Feedback loops are essential for developing expertise. Predictive coding — the brain's ability to generate expectations and compare them to outcomes — underlies learning. Deliberate practice, as described by Anders Ericsson, requires focused attention, immediate feedback, and iterative refinement. Research shows that experts in any domain develop better intuition through thousands of hours of practice with clear feedback. The learning loop leverages neuroplasticity, creating stronger neural pathways for pattern recognition and decision-making. Neuroscience reveals that reflection and review activate the brain's default mode network, enabling insight and pattern detection that might be missed in the moment.

## Case Studies

Reflection improved crisis response and organizational turnarounds. The leader who built daily reflection practices into their team saw faster adaptation and better decision-making. The organization that created structured learning loops after major decisions reduced repeat mistakes and accelerated innovation. These case studies show how leaders who pause to reflect, capture insights, and adjust their approach develop sharper intuition over time. The pattern is clear: those who create learning loops become better decision-makers, turning experience into wisdom.

## Exercises & Worksheet

**1. Daily Reflection**  
Spend 10 minutes each day reflecting on decisions made, signals noticed, and outcomes observed. Capture patterns and insights.

**2. 24-Hour Pause**  
For significant decisions, pause 24 hours after the outcome is clear to reflect on what you sensed, what you missed, and what you learned.

**3. Said vs Unsaid Review**  
Regularly review what was explicitly communicated versus what you intuitively sensed but wasn't stated. Note patterns and accuracy.
