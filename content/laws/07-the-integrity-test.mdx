## Narrative

Small ethical compromises snowball into major problems. Leaders who listen to their unease about ethical gray areas prevent crises before they escalate. The narrative explores how great leaders develop moral intuition, recognizing when something feels off even when it's technically legal or acceptable. This integrity test becomes a critical navigation tool, helping leaders maintain alignment with values and principles even when pressure mounts. The story follows leaders who trusted their moral intuition and course-corrected early, avoiding scandals and preserving trust.

## The Science

Moral intuition operates through the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which processes ethical decisions and generates emotional responses to moral violations. Research by Lawrence Kohlberg and James Rest reveals stages of moral development and the role of moral intuition in ethical decision-making. Neuroscience shows that people with stronger moral intuition make better ethical decisions, especially under pressure. The science reveals how to develop moral awareness, distinguish between legal and ethical, and maintain integrity when it's difficult. However, moral intuition can be distorted by self-interest, group pressure, or gradual ethical drift.

## Case Studies

Scandals often start with small compromises that felt wrong but were rationalized away. Leaders who listened to their moral unease and course-corrected early avoided major problems. The executive who felt uncomfortable with a business practice despite legal clearance prevented a crisis. The founder who trusted their intuition about a partner's ethics avoided a damaging partnership. These case studies demonstrate how moral intuition helps leaders maintain integrity and avoid ethical pitfalls. The pattern is consistent: those who develop moral awareness and trust their integrity test make better ethical decisions.

## Exercises & Worksheet

**1. Ethical Signal Journaling**  
Document moments when something feels ethically off, even if it's technically acceptable. Track patterns and outcomes.

**2. Values Map**  
Create a clear map of your core values and principles. Use it as a compass for decision-making, especially in gray areas.

**3. Mirror Test**  
Regularly ask: Would I be comfortable if this decision were on the front page of the newspaper? Would I be proud to explain it to my children?
